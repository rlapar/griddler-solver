# griddler-solver

## Ideas
- project structure
    - reader, renderer, solver
    - model --> Griddler pydantic model
- CLI with multiple commands - visualize, solve, show iteration, solution to griddle...
- represent the griddle assignment as a list of two lists (rows, columns), and maybe the dimensions (validate input) 
- represent the griddle solution as a string with 0, 1, ? symbols (validate input)
- store iterative solutions
- different algorithms (brute force, heuristics)
- maybe UI in the end?
- maybe colors in the end?
